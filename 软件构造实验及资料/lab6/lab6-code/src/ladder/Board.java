  // Safety from rep exposure:
  // state is private and it's primitive variant,monkey is private and it can be changed with
  // limited method.
  // Thread safety argument:
  // state is immutable,so it is thread-safe.Monkey's change is synchronized.Although the value of
  // state is associated with the value of monkey,it is still thread-safe because setMonkey() is
  // synchronized,which change the monkey and state at the same synchronized block.
